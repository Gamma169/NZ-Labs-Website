				<p class="contentParagraph" style="top:650px; left:400px; width:600px;">
					Spectrum: An Elegy for Piano is a puzzle-adventure game based on the concept of synesthesia.  Synesthesia is an ability some people have where their senses overlap and the particular type of synesthesia the game is dealing with is sight and sound.  When the main character hears music, he sees beautiful colors.  He uses his abilities to solve puzzles, help musicians and bring the color and happiness back into his world.
